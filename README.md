# U.S.-retail-sales
We will use a Kaggle data set that will give the total monthly retail sales in the US from January 1992 until June 2021. This project aims to perform predictive analytics on U.S. retail sales data to identify trends, forecast future sales, and derive actionable insights for retailers and stakeholders. By leveraging historical sales data, the project will utilize machine learning techniques to build robust models that can predict future retail performance.

As a Data analysis, we will perform the following steps:
1. Plot the data with proper labeling and make some observations on the graph.
2. Split this data into a training and test set. Use the last year of data (July 2020 â€“ June 2021) as your test set and the rest as your training set.
3. Use the training set to build a predictive model for the monthly retail sales.
4. Use the model to predict the monthly retail sales on the last year of data.
5. Report the RMSE of the model predictions on the test set.
